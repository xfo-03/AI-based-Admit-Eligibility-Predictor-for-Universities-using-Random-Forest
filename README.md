# AI-based-Admit-Eligibility-Predictor-for-Universities-using-Random-Forest
Project Name: University Admit Eligibility Predictor

Description: As a data science project, we developed a University Admit Eligibility Predictor that predicts the eligibility of a student for admission to a university based on their academic performance and other factors such as standardized test scores, scores for their SOP, LOR, and research experiences.

Algorithm: The project used the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression. Random Forests build multiple decision trees and combine their predictions to get a more accurate result.

Platform: The project was developed using Python programming language and various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. In addition, the project was deployed on the IBM Cloud platform, which provided a scalable and secure environment for hosting the application.

Correlation with IBM Cloud: The project used the IBM Cloud platform to deploy the University Admit Eligibility Predictor application. The platform provided various services such as Cloud Foundry, which allowed for easy deployment and scaling of the application. Additionally, the IBM Cloud Object Storage service was used for storing and retrieving the training data used in the project. The project also used IBM Watson Studio for data exploration and visualization, which is a powerful tool for data scientists.
